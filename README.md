Call a "word path" a sequence of words where each successive word differs from the last only by a single letter (added, removed, changed). Given a starting word and a list of words, one per file (as in /usr/dict/words), write a program to find the longest word path in a dictionary of words. Sample:




Given list "a", "ab", "ac", "ad","abc", "ade" and word "abcd"

Expected result "abcd", "abc", "ab", "a", "ac", "ad", "ade"
